# Reflection — How My Understanding of Security Has Changed

### Earlier Assumptions

Initially, I believed that:

- Attacks relied on broken or misconfigured systems  
- Malicious traffic was obviously abnormal  
- Encryption automatically implied safety  

These assumptions shaped how I approached cybersecurity.

---

### What I Understand Now

I have realized that:

- Most attacks **exploit normal system behavior**  
- Many attacks use **valid, protocol-compliant traffic**  
- Security failures often arise from **trusted assumptions**, not technical flaws  

This fundamentally changes how I view systems, threats, and defense.

---

### How Attackers Think at Higher Layers

Attackers:

- Study system assumptions  
- Minimize their own cost  
- Blend into legitimate behavior  

They **do not fight systems**.  
They **cooperate dishonestly**, allowing normal operations to produce harm.

---

### Designing Safer Systems

If I were designing systems today, I would:

- Reduce early trust  
- Expire assumptions quickly  
- Design for **recovery**, not just prevention  

Failure is not always avoidable, but **uncontrolled failure is**.

### Key Insight

> Defense is not only about protection.  
> It is about **surviving damage intelligently**.
