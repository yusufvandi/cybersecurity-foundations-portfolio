Week 1 – OSI Model Security Foundations
This week focuses on understanding the OSI model from a defensive security perspective, with particular attention to how attacks on lower layers could undermine higher – layer protections.
The goal was not memorization, but developing intuition about:
Where trusts exists in network design
How attackers exploit implicit trust
Why perimeter defenses alone are insufficient  

Focus Areas
OSI model as a security framework
Layer – specific attack surfaces
Case – study: ARP spoofing at Layer 2
Defensive controls beyond firewalls
This repository documents my technical understanding and reflections from week 1
