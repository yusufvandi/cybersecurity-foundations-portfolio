OSI Threat Mapping Overview
The OSI model provides a useful framework for understanding how different classes of attacks target different layers of a system.

OSI Layer
Primary Function
Example Threats

Layer 1 – Physical 
Transmission Medium
Cable tapping, hardware tampering

Layer 2 – Data Link 
MAC addressing, ARP
ARP spoofing, MAC flooding

Layer 3 – Network 
IP routing
IP spoofing, routing attacks

Layer 4 – Transport 
End – to – end delivery
SYN floods

Layers 5 – 7 - Upper Layers 
Sessions, presentations, applications 
XXS, SQL injection, session hacking, https downgrading etc.


A critical observation is that lower – layer compromises often enable or simplify higher – layer attacks, even when encryption and firewalls are in place.
