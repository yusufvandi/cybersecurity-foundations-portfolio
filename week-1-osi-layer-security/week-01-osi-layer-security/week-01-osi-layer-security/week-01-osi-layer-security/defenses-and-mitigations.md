Defensive Control Against Layer 2 Attacks
Effect defense against Layer 2 attacks requires controls beyond traditional firewalls.
Key Defensive Measures
Network segmentation (VLANs)
Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)
Port security on switches
Static ARP entries for critical systems 
Continuous internal traffic monitoring
Key Insights
Security is not achieved by a single control. It emerges from layered defenses assume internal compromise is possible.
Designing networks with this assumption significantly reduces attacker effectiveness.
