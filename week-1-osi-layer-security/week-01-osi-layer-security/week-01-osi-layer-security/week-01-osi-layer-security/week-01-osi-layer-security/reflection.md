Week 1 Reflection
Before this study, I viewed firewalls as the primary line of defense in a network.
This week changed that perspective. I realized that many attacks succeed not because defenses fail, but because trust is misplaced at lower layers.
Understanding that attackers often exploit design assumptions – rather than software bugs – has shaped how I think about network security.
Going forward, I aim to study each topic with the question:
“Where does the system assume trust, and how could that trust be abused?”
